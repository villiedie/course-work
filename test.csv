This	O
was	O
a	O

with	O
my	O

However	O

over	O

I	O
have	O
started	O
having	O
vaginal	B-Disease

almost	O
every	O

the	O
month	O

Lots	O

I	O

I	O

When	O
I	O
came	O

I	O

will	O
be	O
telling	O

Although	O
this	O

with	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
not	O

I	O
was	O

The	O
first	O

After	O
about	O

when	O

it	O

I	O
went	O

my	O

in	O

he	O

I	O

he	O

I	O
finally	O
went	O
to	O

the	O

in	O
March	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
my	O

"	O

"	O

if	O
I	O
continued	O
with	O
the	O

me	O
the	O

at	O

I	O
found	O
it	O
best	O
to	O

the	O

at	O
night	O
only	O
although	O
you	O
can	O
replace	O
it	O
every	O
12	O

I	O
put	O
the	O

on	O
at	O
