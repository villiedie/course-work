I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
after	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-Disease
climbed	I-Disease
to	O
310	O
.	O

I	O
Did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
because	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
vegetarian	O
,	O
a	O
health	O
conscious	O
person	O
and	O
dislike	O
taking	O
medicines	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
doctor	O
,	O
an	O
endocrynologist	O
,	O
strongly	O
recommended	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
few	O
months	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
aware	O
of	O
any	O
side	O
effects	O
,	O
but	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
ago	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
experience	O
wrist	B-Disease
pain	I-Disease
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
pilates	O
class	O
,	O
but	O
although	O
I	O
rested	O
for	O
2	O
months	O
from	O
the	O
class	O
,	O
the	O
pain	B-Disease
continued	O
.	O

Then	O
about	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
very	O
bad	O
cramps	B-Disease
in	O
my	O
toes	O
,	O
they	O
curled	O
down	O
and	O
the	O
pain	B-Disease
was	O
terrible	O
.	O

About	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
a	O
bath	O
and	O
my	O
muscles	B-Disease
in	I-Disease
my	I-Disease
lower	I-Disease
abdomen	I-Disease
started	I-Disease
to	I-Disease
contract	I-Disease
then	O
the	O
cramp	O
got	O
higher	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
scared	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
something	O
bad	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
cramps	B-Disease
one	O
night	O
I	O
had	O
such	O
tiredness	O
in	O
my	O
left	O
leg	O
that	O
I	O
could	B-Disease
hardly	I-Disease
walk	I-Disease
,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
high	O
heels	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
worn	O
all	O
day	O
.	O

Then	O
2	O
days	O
ago	O
I	O
woke	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
swollen	B-Disease
foot	I-Disease
,	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
painful	B-Disease
to	I-Disease
walk	I-Disease
.	O

That	O
was	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
suspected	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
internet	O
and	O
read	O
the	O

side	O

in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
posting	O
their	O

with	O
this	O

I	O
even	O
thought	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
ALS	B-Disease
since	O
a	O
friend	O

mine	O
died	O
of	O
it	O

It	O
is	O
amazing	O
the	O

that	O
also	O

the	O

in	O
this	O

Thanks	O
God	O
for	O
the	O
Internet	O

I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
this	O

2	O
days	O

,	O
I	O
hope	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
these	O
effects	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
permanent	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
recommend	O
it	O
,	O
unless	O
it	O
is	O
life	O

then	O
only	O
take	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
time	O

Was	O
on	O

Dr	O
switched	O
me	O
to	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
since	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
effective	O
.	O

After	O
78	O
days	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
,	O
I	O
had	O
constant	B-Disease
low	I-Disease

in	O
my	O

and	O
upper	O
thighs	O
.	O

Strong	B-Disease
pain	I-Disease
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
randomly	O

There	O
would	O
be	O
spikes	B-Disease
of	I-Disease
pain	I-Disease
so	I-Disease
severe	I-Disease
that	O
I	O
felt	O

I	O

sit	O
down	O
for	O
5	O
or	O
10	O

After	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
,	O
the	O

gradually	O
subsided	O
over	O
a	O
9	O

I	O
was	O

About	O
6	O

I	O

I	O
lasted	O
about	O
2	O

The	O

Then	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
the	O

to	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
causing	O
the	O
pain	O

It	O
was	O
Statin	O

I	O
looked	O
that	O
up	O
and	O
found	O
what	O
it	O
does	O
to	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
any	O
drug	O
and	O
take	O
some	O
Q10	B-Drug
to	O
build	O
my	O

back	O
up	O
.	O

Two	O
months	O
later	O
went	O
back	O
on	O

with	O
the	O
Q10	B-Drug

2	O

I	O

wondering	O
about	O
this	O
back	O

It	O
is	O
a	O

My	O

I	O
'	O
ve	O
tried	O
at	O

this	O

what	O
it	O

I	O

it	O

I	O

altogether	O
if	O
the	O

on	O
this	O

by	O
my	O

for	O
my	O
somewhat	O
high	B-Disease

.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
after	O
starting	O
this	O

,	O
I	O
suddenly	O
felt	B-Disease
like	I-Disease
I	I-Disease
had	I-Disease
aged	I-Disease
to	I-Disease
eighty	I-Disease
years	I-Disease
old	I-Disease
overnight	I-Disease
but	O
did	O
not	O

it	O
to	O
starting	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
.	O

Up	O
until	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
this	O
drug	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
young	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
twenties	O
and	O
wondered	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
how	O
you	O
might	O
start	O
feeling	O
the	O
affects	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
by	O
waking	O
up	O
one	O
morning	O
and	O
feeling	B-Disease
all	I-Disease
that	I-Disease
age	I-Disease
caught	I-Disease
up	I-Disease
with	I-Disease
you	I-Disease
and	O
now	O
you	O
were	O
older	O
than	O
your	O
years	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
two	O
terrible	O
months	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
and	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
had	O
dropped	O
.	O

My	O
doctor	O
mailed	O
me	O
the	O
results	O
of	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
refilled	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
within	O
two	O
months	O
I	O
was	O
feeling	O
normal	O
again	O
and	O
even	O
took	O
a	O
job	O
with	O
the	O
post	O
office	O
where	O
I	O
walked	O
five	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
with	O
no	O
problem	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
associate	O
my	O
getting	O
better	O
with	O
my	O
coming	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
,	O
unfortunately	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
appointment	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O
prescription	O
by	O
calling	O
his	O
office	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
after	O
taking	O
only	O
one	O
pill	O
,	O
I	B-Disease
was	I-Disease
eighty	I-Disease
years	I-Disease
old	I-Disease
again	O
.	O

This	O
time	O
I	O
did	O
associate	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
then	O
read	O
the	O
warnings	O
the	O
drug	O
store	O
gives	O
you	O
with	O
meds	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
what	O
they	O
warned	O
against	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
hypochondriac	B-Disease
and	O
I	O
never	O
read	O
those	O
warnings	O
so	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
head	O
thing	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
but	O
a	O
year	O
later	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
eighty	B-Disease
years	I-Disease
old	I-Disease
feeling	I-Disease
and	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
ever	O
be	O
normal	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
how	O
just	O
one	O
pill	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
and	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
recovering	O
like	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
.	O

This	O
has	O
ruined	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
taken	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
if	O
I	O
knew	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
sorry	O
that	O
I	O
ever	O
heard	O
of	O
this	O
drug	O

This	O
is	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
even	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
can	O
cause	O
permanent	O
damage	O

My	O

,	O
when	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
wanted	O
to	O
change	O
statins	O
because	O
he	O
was	O

worried	O
about	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
no	O
more	O
statins	O
and	O
he	O
then	O
prescribed	O
Zetia	B-Drug
,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
was	O
less	O
effective	O
but	O
was	O
not	O

I	O
wouldn	O

it	O
did	O
nothing	O
for	O
the	O
inflammation	B-Disease
in	O
the	O
knee	O
and	O
has	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
panic	O
until	O
I	O
can	O
get	O
this	O
stuff	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
system	O
.	O

Possibly	O
diarrhea	B-Disease

stomach	B-Disease
pain	I-Disease

but	O
most	O

none	O

I	O

taking	O
this	O
with	O
a	O

antibiotic	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
sinus	B-Disease

I	O
was	O

to	O
take	O
it	O
2x	O

day	O
for	O
7	O
days	O
and	O
then	O
2x	O

day	O
as	O
needed	O

I	O
completed	O
the	O
7	O
days	O
and	O
then	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
it	O

The	O

which	O
is	O

I	O
'	O

enables	O
me	O
to	O
